Elden Ring Fanpage (2nd Project)
A webpage to test my css without copying youtube tutorials. I solely used stack overflow and mdn as resources.
I can proudly say that this project was very fun to work on and ive learned more than I ever could building it out instead of copying code from a tutorial. I still feel I have a good bit to go with css positioning, mobile repsonsiveness and having clean css in general. Regardless im happy with the end result.
